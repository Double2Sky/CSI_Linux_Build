Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Search [existing issues](https://github.com/infosecwriter/CSI_Linux_Build/issues) to ensure that feature is not already being worked on.  If it is, use the issue to mention that you would can offer assistance to the original author.
* Create a [new issue]((https://github.com/infosecwriter/CSI_Linux_Build/issues/new)) describing the feature before beginning work.  This will help reduce duplicate work, as well as let you collect feedback from the community.
